# Software-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client for this project seeking to develop a web-based application to run a popular game, Draw it or Lose it. The Gaming Room wanted to run this application on a variety of platforms with servers to store user data and host a number of individual game instances simultaneously.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think the part of the project I was most effective in was detailing the different platform hosting options that could be used for this application. Operating systems considered included Linux, Mac, Windows, and Mobile devices. The reasoning was interesting to research, however I think the final choice was always likely to be the Windows OS due to the popularity and accessibility of it.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think the design document was very helpful in laying out the exact intent of the application, while accounting for the nuance of what the client wanted to use it for and what their experience with development and limitations were.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think if I were to go back and revise anything it would be the overall coding for the project. I think this is always a good space to revisit because of the nature of programming and that we are always constantly changing and improving our process. I think there is always a better way to organize code and comment it to better communicate the intent.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs at their base were pretty self-explanatory to implent, with well-outlined requirements for the application. I think the biggest interpretation of the user needs that was implemented was the choice of operating system for the application itself, because the primary goal was accessibility of the application to be used for customers.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Much of the coding for the software was pre-built was changes needed as part of the assignments, so much of the design was already done. For the most part I tried to followed the provided organization with commenting about necessary changes to fulfil the requirement. In the future I would follow a similar class structure as this assignment because I think it was very well organized and understandable.
